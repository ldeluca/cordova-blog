Apache Cordova is going global!  Apache Cordova is already being used by developers all over the world and now, we are proud to announce, the Apache Cordova documentation will be translated into a number of languages.  But we need your help!  With the support of Crowdin, a translation and localization management platform, translators can login to the easy-to-use tooling and provide as much or as little translation assistance as they would like.  If you know another language please support Cordova and contribute.
